Hands-on architecture projects with production-style designs and documentation. Focus areas: Kubernetes (EKS), serverless (Lambda + API Gateway), Terraform & CI/CD, S3 + CloudFront, DynamoDB, and security (IAM, KMS, GuardDuty, Secrets Manager).

What you’ll find:
* EKS Cluster Setup & Autoscaling — IaC, node groups, HPA, rollout/rollback runbook
* CI/CD: CodePipeline → CodeBuild → CodeDeploy — staged releases, approvals, auto-rollback
* Serverless APIs (Lambda + API Gateway) — versioned stages, throttling, logs & alerts
* Static Delivery (S3 + CloudFront, OAC & TLS) — private origins, caching, invalidations
* Cross-Account ECR Strategy — image sharing across environments
* DynamoDB Data Modeling — access patterns, keys, GSIs, capacity tips
* Security Guardrails — IAM least-privilege, KMS encryption, GuardDuty, Secrets rotation
* Multi-Cloud Transfer (AWS ↔ GCP) — patterns, guardrails, trade-offs

Each project folder contains short PDFs (overview, architecture, IaC, deployment, security, ops). Start with 01 Overview.pdf in each folder.
